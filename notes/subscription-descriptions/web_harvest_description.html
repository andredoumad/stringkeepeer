Stringkeeper web harvest service automatically extracts the type of information from the internet that you're interested in and stores it into a spreadsheet. 

<h3>Web harvest solves the following problem:</h3> 
Search engines don’t find or store all the content on a web page; they simply link you to the content’s location.

The harvest process executes searches then extracts all of the text content from each of the results pages and uses natural language processing to collate for some type of analysis based on your harvest configuration.

Many times you may not be sure where the target data is on the internet, web harvest eliminates hours of manual web searching and data mining. 

With web harvest you can describe what phrases and keywords interest you and which do not. Then you define what type of data you are looking to find in the spreadsheet. Basic data types include the following but are not limited to:

<div class="card bg-dark text-white text-center mx-2 my-2" >

The machine saves you time as it reads millions of lines of text each day without wasting a minute of your day.

Each machine provides several reports. Reports include the history of websites that were visited including what was found on them.
